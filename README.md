# Java

## Multithreading

- Multithreading is a programming concept where a single program (process) runs multiple threads concurrently(not necessarily simultaneously).

- Process -	A running instance of a program. Has its own memory space, files, and resources.
- Thread - A smaller unit of execution within a process. Shares the same memory and resources with other threads of that process.
- Synchronization : Since threads share memory, two threads might try to modify the same variable at the same time, causing race conditions. Synchronization prevents this by allowing only one thread at a time to access a shared resource.
