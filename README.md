# Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java World!");
    }
}
```


## Multithreading

- Multithreading is a programming concept where a single program (process) runs multiple threads concurrently(not necessarily simultaneously).

- Process -	A running instance of a program. Has its own memory space, files, and resources.
- Thread - A smaller unit of execution within a process. Shares the same memory and resources with other threads of that process.
- Synchronization - Since threads share memory, two threads might try to modify the same variable at the same time, causing race conditions. Synchronization prevents this by allowing only one thread at a time to access a shared resource.
- Locking - Every object in Java has an internal lock. When a thread enters a synchronized block, it acquires the lock. Other threads must wait until it’s released.
- Deadlock - Occurs when two threads hold locks that each other needs — so neither proceeds.
- Race Conditions - When two or more threads access shared data without synchronization, results become unpredictable.
